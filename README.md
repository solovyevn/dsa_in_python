Python implementation of many data structures and algorithms following the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X?tag=amazon0fe8d-20" target="_blank">well-known DSA book by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne*</a>.

I used Python to better learn in practice the topics from the book, that uses Java to teach the DSA, so the code is often not pythonic, but rather implemented using basic constructs to focus on the algorithms and data structures themselves.  
Decided to make it public, since it might be useful for someone to refer in their learning.  
The code is old though, and I do not intend to maintain this, so please feel free to fork it and implement any changes there.  
Everyting is shared AS IS and there might be bugs, errors and etc.
